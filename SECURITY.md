# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy and procedures for the Spice.xyz Grafana Plugin. Please use this as a guideline for reporting security vulnerabilities that you might discover in our code.

### Supported Versions

We are committed to patching all security vulnerabilities in the latest major version of the plugin. Security updates will be applied to other versions as described below:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.1   | :white_check_mark: |
| <0.0.1  | :x:                |

*Note: Older versions will no longer receive security updates. We encourage you to update to the latest version.*

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Should you identify a vulnerability in the plugin, we would greatly appreciate your assistance by informing us about it.

Here's how you can report an issue:

1. Please contact us by sending an email to [security@spice.ai](mailto:security@spice.ai). 
2. Describe the vulnerability in as much detail as possible. Information such as the conditions on which reproducing the bug is contingent, its potential impact, and your possible solutions are all very helpful. 
3. Do not publicize the vulnerability until we've had a chance to investigate and respond to it.

**Please do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability.**

Once we have received your email, we will strive to confirm the receipt within 3 business days. After our initial assessment and reproduction of the vulnerability, we will aim to keep you informed about the progress towards the resolution, and may request additional information or guidance.

We appreciate your patience as we work to ensure the security and integrity of our software.

### Disclosure Policy

When a security issue is reported, we will confirm the issue, assess its impact, and release a patch as quickly as possible. Once a patch has been released, we will publicly disclose the issue.

Please refrain from disclosing the vulnerability to others until we've had a chance to address it.

### Comments on This Policy

If you have any suggestions to improve this policy, please submit a pull request.

## Thank you!

We greatly appreciate any effort to discover and disclose security vulnerabilities responsibly. Your contributions help us ensure the security and privacy of our users.
